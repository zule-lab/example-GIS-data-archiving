# GIS Data Archiving Guidelines
Hello!  
So exciting that you are contributing to the ZULE lab GIS database, thank you! The `2021-07-14_example-layer_IR` folder outlines a practical example of **how** to contribute to the ZULE lab's GIS database.  

Please read these guidelines before adding to the database. If you have any questions, ask someone who has already submitted to the database to help you.  
1. Versions
- Please only save final versions of your layer(s) to the GIS database. If you are still working on it, feel free to drop it in later when you're completely done.  

2. Naming 
- Please use descriptive and helpful naming conventions. For your folder and files, please follow this format: 
yyyy-mm-dd_layer-description_initials 
e.g. 2021-07-14_example-layer_IR
- Please avoid using spaces, punctuation, and accented characters when naming your files 

3. File Format 
- Please submit your GIS file(s) as a Geopackage. 
- If you do not know how to write a geopackage in the software you are using, there are many resources online and in our lab!
- Why are we using geopackages? Check out switchfromshapefile.org
- Using geopackages in R: https://ryanpeek.org/mapping-in-R-workshop/02_import_export_gpkg.html

4. Metadata
- Please accompany your file submission with a metadata file following the format of the metadata found in 2021-07-14_example-layer_IR
